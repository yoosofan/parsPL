This is my attempt to make a persian based programming language. It uses `PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/index.html>`_ for parsing.

".psl" files are input files of the langauge.

You can find my old bazaar (bzr) files in "old.bzr.folder" which includes all the changes of the source code in bzr system. Migrating to "git" took time, therefore, I consider making a new git branch.

The ParsePL programming language has fantastic features and ideas that is designed to be easily used by a primary persian school student. 
It is not just a copy cat of another project or ideas. It is fully right to left language designed to be easily undestand by any Persian speaker.
For example names of variables in ParsPL can have spaces on it. It is very useful for a beginner programmer to use space in names of variables but keywords of ParsPL always starts by dot.

"test1.psl" can be opened by any modern editors like pluma or gedit in Linux which supports right to left languages automatically and shows the program right to left.

Run a sample:

.. code:: sh

  python3 run.py test1.psl

This project started at 2010 and fininshed in 2013.

For more information about ParsPL language and its compiler you can read its Persian report in `<docs/report.fa.pdf>`_

I may not able to continue to work on this project and provide new update but I am ready to check and probably accept your useful request pulls.

The best compiler and interpreter construction tools for this project is PLY. Antlr does not easily support unicode characters but PLY does. Don't search any other tool because your time is limited and you can not spend a lot of time on testing other tools.
